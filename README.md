# Dirichlet Kernel Ternary Viewer

An interactive R Shiny application for semi-parametric analysis and visualization of compositional data using Dirichlet kernel smoothing and backfitting.

## 🧠 Features

- Upload your own dataset or use built-in simulated data
- Interactive ternary plots of compositional data
- Dirichlet kernel smoothing with user-defined or cross-validated bandwidth
- Semi-parametric regression via backfitting
- Bootstrap inference for linear covariates
- Parallel computation support

## 📦 Installation

```r
# Required packages
install.packages(c("shiny", "DT", "ggplot2", "shinycssloaders", "MCMCpack", "foreach", "doParallel"))
```

- **Tab 1: Data Preparation**
  - Upload CSV file or use built-in example data
  - Select 3 compositional variables (must sum to 1)
  - Choose covariates and response variable  
    ⚠️ *Note: Currently, at least two covariates must be selected to ensure proper functioning of the app.*

- **Tab 2: Ternary Plot**
  - Visualize smoothed response using Dirichlet kernel smoothing
  - Adjust bandwidth (`h`) manually or via cross-validation  
    ⚠️ *Note: The cross-validation interval must be carefully chosen. The default range may not always work.*  
    *If the app crashes or closes automatically, try expanding the interval range, as convergence may have failed.*
  - Customize color scale and display options
    🎨 **Scale color low / high**: Set the gradient colors for the smoothed ternary plot (e.g., yellow → blue).
    🏷 **Color bar title**: Customize the label shown on the color bar (e.g., "Predicted Y").
    🖼 **Plot title**: Add a custom title to the ternary plot for display or export.
    🧱 **Resolution slider**: Controls the grid density of smoothed values. Higher resolution = smoother but slower.
    🔲 **Show boundary**: Toggle to display boundary lines based on observed data limits.


- **Tab 3: Semi-parametric Estimation**
  - Run backfitting algorithm
  - Bootstrap inference for covariates
  - Visualize residual nonparametric effects
